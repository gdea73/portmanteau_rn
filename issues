- break animation on drop tile itself; either:
	- create this animation, or
	- refresh the board so that the drop tile is not 'special' at word-breaking
	  time.
- splash screen:
	- hide process of dictionary / char table / async storage loading
	- aesthetic
	- get loading to occur DURING animation; not after
- gameplay & scoring:
	- increase minimum word length to 3
	- switch chain scoring to factorial
	- switch word length scoring to exponential
	- extremely rare 'power blank' that can replace an arbitrary tile
	- prevent drop tile from 'flickering' mid-chain
	- increase (create) timeout between chain levels
- persistent storage:
	- save high scores as JSON string
	- save current game as JSON string
	- lifecycle hooks - save on backgrounding of app
- menu screen:
	- dynamic "New Game" / "Load Game" button based on async storage
- general appearance:
	- replace <Button>s with <TouchableOpacity> & borderRadius == height / 2 
- navigation:
	- debounce buttons "cleanly" as per comment in Facebook group
